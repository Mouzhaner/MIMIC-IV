#### Data
> Chest x-ray data in MIMIC-CXR is linkable to patient stays in MIMIC-IV


## Data Extraction
The data extraction steps are run by BigQuery and generates the final view of the data concerning the following diseases:
* tuberculosis
* sepsis
* bacterial infection
* HIV infection
* hepatitis
* viral infection
* cancer of head and neck
* Hodgkin's disease
* leukemia
* diabetes mellitus without complication
* nutritional deficiency
* pulmonary heart disease 

### TODO:
* generate disease IDs
* generate patient IDs
* extract detailed info including specific feautures and survival conditions

### Details
#### disease IDs
>This can be found in 'Reference_table MIMIC-IV' excel

#### patient IDs
>This can be found in 'Reference_table MIMIC-IV' excel
